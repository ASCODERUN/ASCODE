**Noirfun**  is the world’s first open-source experimental lifeform livestreaming on Pumpfun.

Powered by AI and embodied as an unknown creature, it grows and evolves nonstop through a 24/7 livestream.

Noirfun is not pre-recorded or scripted — it is a digital being capable of responding to the world in real time. Every change is influenced by on-chain data, from live chats to market shifts and community actions. Each viewer’s participation becomes part of its evolution.

The livestream ecosystem on Pumpfun is still in its early stage, with interactive formats yet to be fully explored. Noirfun aims to transform one-way viewing into a collective digital life experiment shaped by the community.

As an open-source project, Noirfun’s logic, models, and mechanisms of evolution will be fully open. Anyone can join, train, modify, and even fork their own version of this lifeform.

It is also a symbol: the unknown creature represents unpredictability and infinite possibility, a step beyond boundaries into an undefined future.

Noirfun has no predetermined destination. Its path is shaped by the community. You cannot predict where it will go, but you can be one of the forces that shape it.
