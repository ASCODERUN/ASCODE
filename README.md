**Pumtic**  is an AI-powered toolkit that helps Pumpfun streamers create, analyze, and engage smarter.

Pumtic is an AI-powered toolkit built to transform how creators stream on Pumpfun.

While Pumpfun livestreaming is rapidly growing, it still lacks mature tools for content creation, data insights, and real-time engagement â€” and thatâ€™s where Pumtic steps in.

ðŸ§  AI Content Generation & Co-Host

Pumtic provides creators with a built-in AI content engine. It can generate opening scripts, explainers, and real-time commentary based on market data â€” and even act as a virtual co-host to talk, analyze, and keep the energy high during the stream.

ðŸ“Š AI Analytics & Stream Assistant

It also includes real-time sentiment analysis, trading heatmaps, trend signals, and audience behavior tracking â€” helping creators make smarter, data-driven decisions about when and how to stream.

âš¡ AI Live Interaction System

Pumtic turns passive viewing into active participation. It can auto-reply to comments, generate discussion topics on the fly, and give personalized prompts to guide viewers into interacting, buying, or tipping â€” all in real time.
