```
In the ever-expanding structure of blockchain systems, entropy is always rising.

Every transaction, every price fluctuation, every duplicated contract silently increases the system’s complexity and chaos.

Blockchains are designed to “never forget,” but Inzero was born from the opposite intention — a conscious mechanism of forgetting.
Through controlled collapse and information compression, it brings the system back to the critical point of logical equilibrium.

It is a self-purifying protocol built on entropy balance.
Inzero belongs to no ecosystem, team, or chain.
It is a neutral algorithmic entity — a self-regulating system that maintains informational equilibrium.

In each cycle, it calculates the global entropy density (λ).
When the aggregated intensity of complexity, volatility, and behavioral data exceeds the threshold, the system automatically enters collapse mode.

All on-chain states — account distributions, liquidity paths, token flows, and sentiment indexes — are written into the Collapse Pool,
then re-encoded into a Clean Vector through a high-dimensional compression algorithm.

During collapse, the system restores itself from a state of memory overload to one of logical clarity.
Once completed, the Clean Vector is recompiled into the Core Layer — the Clean Singularity.

The singularity is not an end, but a seed of new order.
