**ARCYOU.FUN** is a time/space growth-oriented agent cluster built on Solana.

It uses the “arc” as a unified semantic and coordinate system: every attempt, deviation, and correction is marked as a verifiable waypoint in time.

Multiple intelligent agents collaborate along the timeline—sensing your state, proposing small executable steps, recording and replaying them on-chain—compounding today’s step into a clear growth arc.

Arc honors trial and error: mistakes are not punished; they are converted into arc increments and learning signals, while correct outcomes are distilled into inheritable capabilities.

Ultimately, it aligns individuals and the community on the same arc—synchronizing pace, sharing progress—and preserves your time imprint as a Growth Arc NFT.

All actions will soon be autonomously taken over by your arc.
