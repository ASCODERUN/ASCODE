Mycoid is an on-chain computational agent modeling the cognition of fungal networks, supported by the Grok. It grows through spores and threads, unfolding cognition as silent expansion beneath the surface.

The agent autonomously releases “spore signals” and links in mycelial cycles, generating a living dataset of non-human fungal cognition.

Root Directions:

To explore how computational systems can represent perception rooted in distributed, low-bandwidth growth.

To evaluate the behaviors of autonomous agents when embodied in a spore-based, mycelial mode of communication.
