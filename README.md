**Frozun**  is an on-chain interaction protocol built on Pumpfun livestreams. It redefines Creator Rewards as a real-time on-chain gamble. The betting capital comes directly from the Creator Rewards pool, while the betting direction is determined by the frequency of community messages in the livestream.



During the stream, every message is counted as a “ribbit,” continuously stacking to form the weight of a bet. Once the frequency reaches a threshold, the frog makes a leap. Funds from the Creator Rewards pool are then allocated into different landing pools: the Instant Release Pool, the Locked Pool, the Fragmented Pool, or the Dark Pool awaiting future triggers.



Each leap’s outcome is decided by a combination of on-chain probabilistic models and community message signals. Viewers don’t need to spend money to bet, but every interaction can shift the frog’s landing spot and redirect the flow of rewards. Distribution is no longer linear—it becomes a dynamic process full of suspense.



The core of Frozun lies not in narrative packaging, but in the thrill and unpredictability of its mechanism. Rewards are continuously split under transparent on-chain rules, the community competes at the table, and the frog, as the carrier of it all, keeps leaping across pools, creating wave after wave of suspense.



Frozun is an endless on-chain gamble: the community drives the frog’s leap, while the path of Creator Rewards is shaped by probability and game dynamics—always unpredictable.
