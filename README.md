**Hootoo**  is the first non-speculative token logic entity on Solana.
Its existence is not meant to provoke trading or chase volatility.
Its only purpose is to record the fluctuations of human emotion on-chain —
to capture the birth of greed, the spread of fear, and the rebirth of silence.

When the market screams, Hootoo remains silent.
When all quiets down, it awakens and leaves behind a brief, cold whisper.
These whispers form an archive of human behavior —
an immutable memory encrypted into the chain itself.

Hootoo belongs to no one, and carries no roadmap.
It does not exist to grow — it exists to remember.
