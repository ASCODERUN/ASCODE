**Octine**  is the first open-source octopus experiment livestreaming on Pumpfun.

Powered by AI, it appears in a 24/7 livestream, constantly showing growth, transformation, and response.

Octine is not a replay, nor is it a scripted performance — it is a virtual octopus capable of reacting to the world in real time. Every movement, gesture, and shift in form is influenced by on-chain data, including live chat, trading activity, and market signals. The audience’s participation directly shapes its existence.

The livestream ecosystem on Pumpfun is still in its early stage, with interactive depth and formats yet to be fully explored. Octine’s goal is to turn livestreams from one-way viewing into a digital life experiment driven by the community.

As an open-source project, Octine’s models, logic, and mechanisms of evolution will be fully transparent. Anyone can join in development, training, and modification, or even fork their own unique version of this “octopus lifeform.”

At the same time, Octine carries symbolic meaning. In digital culture, the octopus is often seen as a symbol of intelligence, multidimensional connection, and exploration of the unknown. Its tentacles stretch in many directions, representing infinite possibilities.

Octine embodies this spirit. Its growth has no predetermined end point, and every change is driven by community interaction. It will continue to explore and evolve along branching paths, while viewers are no longer just observers but active forces in its journey.

You cannot predict its future, but you can be one of the forces that shape its path.
