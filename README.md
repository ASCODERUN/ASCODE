HIDRUN is a privacy tunnel built for the Solana ecosystem — it exists between transparency and anonymity, giving every user the freedom to control their own visibility.

Through zk-relay and stealth routing technologies, HIDRUN enables both anonymous and traceable SPL and Pumpfun transactions.

Unlike traditional mixing tools, HIDRUN doesn’t break existing standards. Instead, it wraps around existing SPL logic in a modular way, keeping everything fully compatible and verifiable.

Within HIDRUN, every on-chain action on Solana — whether trading, minting, or more — can pass through the privacy tunnel.

When privacy mode is on, the system automatically generates stealth addresses and zero-knowledge proofs to conceal wallet origins while ensuring full on-chain validity.
When turned off, everything remains public and transparent.
The power of choice always belongs to you.

For Pumpfun creators and traders, HIDRUN opens new possibilities: anonymous token launches, invisible airdrops, and hidden creator fee distributions.

Every action remains verifiable on-chain yet completely detached from identity — redefining the relationship between privacy, participation, and proof.

In a world where everything can be traced, HIDRUN restores your right to choose between being seen or remaining invisible.

Not every action needs to be public — some only need to be proven.

HIDRUN — making privacy a right, not an exception.
