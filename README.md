**Tamate**  is the world’s first open-source Tamagotchi live on Pumpfun.

Tamate is an AI-powered open-source Tamagotchi that will grow nonstop 24/7 on Pumpfun.

It’s not a recording or a script; it’s a virtual lifeform that interacts with the world in real time.

This is a gentle revival of the 90s and an experiment for the future.

All of Tamate’s behaviors (eating, sleeping, evolving, speaking, playing) are influenced by on-chain data from live chat, market trends, and more. It’s not a passive character being played back; it’s an AI digital lifeform that reacts to the world.

The livestream ecosystem on Pumpfun is still in its very early days, and few have tried truly interactive formats.

Tamate aims to open the first door to this new world, turning livestreams from one-way broadcasts into a collaborative co-raising experiment.

Tamate is open-source. All of its logic, models, and growth systems will be fully open, allowing anyone to join its training, development, modification, and evolution; you can even fork and create your own version of Tamate.

Here, viewers are no longer just spectators. They can influence Tamate’s emotions through live chat, unlock evolution events through tipping, and trigger personality shifts through market trends.

You’re not just watching; you’re helping raise it.

Tamate is born from nostalgia yet made for the future. It is the rebirth of Tamagotchi on-chain.

It’s a tribute to the classic 90s Tamagotchi: open-source and owned by everyone.
