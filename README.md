**Puroon**  is the first Pump2ASCII Bridge - a living language layer built on Pumpfun.

> MANY TRADES ++ ++ ++ ONE LANGUAGE . . .

> PUROON SPEAKS . . .

In Puroon, every transaction is captured in real time and transformed into a dynamic stream of ASCII characters.

Buys, sells, price movements, and trading frequency together form the data signals, which are processed through a language-mapping engine and reorganized into rhythmic character flows.

These outputs not only represent the intensity of market activity but also reflect the fluctuations of sentiment and the strength of interaction.

Puroon gives the market a language for the first time - becoming a collective consciousness written by its community.
