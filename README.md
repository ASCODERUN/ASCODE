**VIS1ON**  

What is Vis1on?

Vis1on is a new experimental project born in the Solana ecosystem.

Its core vision is to extend the cultural value of NFTs into new narrative spaces, transforming the classic Mad Lads NFTs into virtual characters and making them the first NFT-based virtual streamers on the Pumpfun platform. Through livestreaming, interaction, and creator rewards, Vis1on converts community entertainment into on-chain value flows.

In the world of Vis1on, Mad Lads are no longer just collectibles — they are given identities, personalities, and a stage. They step out of JPEGs and into real-time interactive livestreams, becoming a new medium for crypto communities and meme culture.

Why was it created?

Many token projects lack a stable value feedback mechanism, leading to short life cycles of “launch — hype — decline.” Vis1on aims to solve this problem through the Perpetual Loop, turning every trade and every interaction into buybacks and burns of the token, creating sustainable positive feedback.

Mad Lads is one of the most influential and popular NFT collections on Solana, symbolizing the spirit and community power of a new generation of Solana NFTs. By choosing Mad Lads as the virtual streamer’s identity, Vis1on not only extends this cultural phenomenon but also leverages its recognition and influence to give the project deeper narrative and stronger credibility.

Thus, the creation of Vis1on is both a cultural experiment and a financial innovation.

On the cultural side, it puts Mad Lads on stage, giving them new life.

On the financial side, it establishes a self-reinforcing value machine powered by trading fees, creator rewards, and perpetual buybacks.
