Mewcam — The Parallel Execution Lightning Virtual Machine

In the blockchain world, speed is survival.

Every transaction, every signal, every on-chain action demands faster response.
Mewcam was created for that — a parallel execution engine built for Solana and Pumpfun,
designed to make smart contracts run at the speed of lightning.

Traditional virtual machines process transactions sequentially — one at a time.
Mewcam introduces Lightning Scheduling, a mechanism that splits transactions into smaller
micro-packets and executes multiple non-conflicting ones in parallel.
Execution, verification, and finalization happen almost instantly, cutting latency to near zero.

At its core, Mewcam runs on Rust + WASM, enhanced with GPU-accelerated verification
for batch processing of signatures, hashes, and Merkle roots within milliseconds.
Its Event Channel system uses a lock-free design to eliminate thread blocking,
while the Speculative Snapshot mechanism detects conflicts, rolls back safely,
and reschedules automatically — ensuring both speed and determinism under high load.

In simple terms, Mewcam transforms blockchains
from slow record-keepers into real-time computation networks.
It behaves like a current of electricity — processing thousands of transactions in milliseconds,
and giving decentralized systems the ability to truly react in real time.
