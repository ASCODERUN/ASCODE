**Sonaun** 

Welcome to Sonaun, where every echo becomes value.

It introduces a unique sonar mapping mechanism, making Creator Rewards no longer just passively distributed numbers, but dynamic asset forms that continuously evolve on-chain in real time.

In the past, livestreams and on-chain assets were separated. Creator Rewards were merely one-way incentives, lacking any deep connection with the community. Sonaun changes this by turning interaction itself into the source of value. 

Through sonar mapping, Creator Rewards evolve with every echo of participation, ultimately forming a real-time expression of on-chain value.

In the Sonaun livestream experience, the core visual element is a constantly extending underwater sonar wave. Every audience interaction—whether a comment, a trade, or another form of participation—creates a pulse injected into this wave. 

As engagement increases, the sonar wave visibly changes: higher peaks reflect increased trading activity, spreading ripples represent rising community momentum, and color shifts from blue to purple and even gold, symbolizing value growth.

This means livestreaming is no longer just about content output, but about the real-time flow of value. Every voice and action from the community directly shapes the sonar wave, is recorded on-chain, and is transformed into a continuously growing form of value.

In short, Sonaun uses sonar mapping to turn interaction into echoes, and to transform Creator Rewards into real-time evolving value, enabling the community to actively participate in the creation of on-chain assets.
