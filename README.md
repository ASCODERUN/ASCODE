ASSETG — The Smart Gateway to Tokenized Stocks Inside Telegram

ASSETG is a next-generation Telegram plugin that transforms how people invest and interact with tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs. Built directly on top of Telegram’s wallet ecosystem, it allows users to trade, track, and automate their portfolios without ever leaving the chat. From real-time market quotes to one-click buy and sell commands, ASSETG turns every conversation into a potential investment opportunity.

Unlike traditional platforms that require switching between apps or navigating complex dashboards, ASSETG keeps everything within Telegram’s familiar interface. Users can connect their Wallet, explore tokenized assets starting from as little as $1 in USDT, and enjoy zero trading fees until January 2026. Through deep integration with Wallet and xStocks infrastructure, every transaction is verified, secure, and transparent.

Beyond trading, ASSETG introduces an intelligent automation layer — enabling DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) plans, custom price alerts, and automatic portfolio rebalancing. Investors can set strategies once and let the system execute them seamlessly, freeing time while maintaining full control.

At its heart, ASSETG also brings a social dimension to investing. Through shared baskets and community portfolios, users can follow creators, exchange insights, and co-invest around market themes like AI, energy, or technology. Every chat becomes a social trading hub where ideas flow as fast as the market itself.

ASSETG isn’t just another tool — it’s the evolution of investing for the chat generation.
Trade. Automate. Connect. All inside Telegram.
