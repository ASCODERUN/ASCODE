⚙️ AURCUB — The Memecoin Reactor

AURCUB is an experimental on-chain system built on Pumpfun, designed to function as a memecoin reaction core.
Its purpose is to observe, collect, and process market signals from multiple memecoin activities, then transform them into measurable, on-chain energy outputs.

The system runs through three main stages:

1️⃣ Signal Intake — AURCUB monitors trading activity and engagement data within the Pumpfun ecosystem, treating each transaction and sentiment change as an energy input.

2️⃣ Core Fusion — These signals are aggregated, analyzed, and converted into “energy density” values representing real-time market intensity. The system’s algorithms continuously rebalance the reactor’s internal state to maintain stability under volatility.

3️⃣ Energy Output — When the internal metrics reach a defined threshold, the reactor emits on-chain reactions — such as triggered events, dashboard updates, or data visualizations — allowing users to track collective memecoin activity in real time.

Unlike typical tokens or hype-driven memecoins, AURCUB does not aim to promote speculation. It serves as a data-driven infrastructure layer that transforms community behavior into transparent, traceable signals.

Its long-term goal is to become a real-time analytics and reaction framework for the memecoin ecosystem — where trading activity and emotion are not just observed, but systematically processed and visualized as on-chain energy flows.
