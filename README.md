**Snowtool**  is a smart livestreaming plugin designed for the next generation of Pumpfun creators. 

The Pumpfun livestream ecosystem is still in its early stage, lacking mature interaction mechanics, data visualization, and content operation tools â€” which makes this the perfect time for Snowtool to emerge. 

Snowtool brings livestreams to life. It integrates real-time market overlays, chat command interactions, and incentive systems into the stream, turning broadcasts from one-way output into on-chain trading shows where everyone participates.

Creators only need to deploy it once to build professional, high-energy live rooms where tokens and communities grow together. 

With Snowtool, viewers are no longer just spectators.
