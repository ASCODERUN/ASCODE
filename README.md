We are building something new.

NOIRPRO — an on-chain protocol plugin for Pumpfun livestreams and SPL tokens.

On Pumpfun, livestreams have become the core scene for creators and communities, but interactions are still surface-level: sending chats, watching prices, making trades. NOIRPRO’s goal is to standardize and protocolize these interactions so they are no longer just performance, but recorded and settled as on-chain value.

With NOIRPRO, every chat, every trade, and even sudden market movements can be written on-chain as verifiable events, further triggering dynamic SPL token mechanisms.

For example, once a livestream reaches a certain level of interaction, Hooton can automatically unlock creator rewards and distribute them among viewers, the streamer, and a community fund. If an SPL token (like $Pump) makes a sharp move, NOIRPRO can trigger bonus rewards or visual effects to heighten engagement.

This means livestreams are no longer just a stage for the streamer, but a space built by the entire community. Every chat and every trade becomes part of collective consensus, driving token flows and shaping new forms of interaction. Viewers are not just watching — they are truly integrated, co-creating value through participation.

NOIRPRO is open-source. Anyone can integrate, modify, and extend it. Our vision is to make NOIRPRO the foundational bridge between livestreams and SPL tokens, transforming fragmented interactions into a unified protocol standard.

NOIRPRO — discover the new possibilities where livestreams and tokens meet.
