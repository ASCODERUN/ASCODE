**Remonk**  is a new experimental project born in the Solana ecosystem. Its core vision is:

Extending the cultural value of NFTs into new narrative spaces.

Transforming the classic SMB Gen2 monkeys into virtual characters, becoming the first NFT-based virtual streamers on the Pumpfun platform.

Turning community entertainment into on-chain value flows through livestreaming, interaction, and creator rewards.

In the world of Remonk, SMB monkeys are no longer just collectibles. They are given identities, personalities, and a stage. They step out of JPEGs and into real-time interactive livestreams, becoming a new medium for crypto communities and meme culture.

Remonk is both the fusion of NFTs and livestreaming, and an experiment in “digitally personified assets” — exploring how NFTs can carry life and narrative beyond the blockchain itself.
