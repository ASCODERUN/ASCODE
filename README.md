**Fravem** 

Pumpfun live streaming is evolving, but the distribution of Creator Rewards remains too traditional.
We bring a new vision: the Raw Stone Protocol.

In Fravem, Creator Rewards are no longer split directly.
They take the form of a raw stone, waiting for the community to forge it together on-chain.

Every chat message and every trade is a cut on the raw stone.
The more interactions, the more unique its shape, color, and brilliance become.

In the end, a one-of-a-kind Raw Stone NFT is forged by the entire community.
It not only carries the rewards but also preserves the memory of the live interaction itself.

Rewards are not released all at once.
Some are unlocked instantly, some are locked inside the Raw Stone NFT, and some remain as fragments to be polished in the next stream.

This means creators must keep streaming, and the community must keep engaging, for rewards to be fully unlocked.

Unlike traditional “buyback-and-burn,” the Raw Stone Protocol allows fragments to be traded or combined.
The reward release process itself becomes a strategic game.

We call this on-chain live experience the Raw Stone Show —
a raw stone that glows, cracks, and gradually takes shape, finally shining as a unique NFT.

The Raw Stone Protocol is not just a distribution tool; it is an on-chain ritual.
Every live stream is a collective act of forging by the community.

This is the fusion of finance and narrative — the next evolution of Pumpfun live streaming.
