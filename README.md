NERUIM is the first Pumpfun protocol that allows creators to automatically share Creator Fees through project connections.

It breaks the old model where creators could only earn from their own projects, enabling value to continuously flow between ideas.

When a new project is created on Pumpfun, the creator can choose to fill in an “inspired by” field linking it to a previous project. After that, a portion of the new project’s Creator Fee will automatically flow back to the referenced upstream project’s holders.

In this way, inspiration is no longer a one-time act, but a traceable and transferable value relationship. Every project can gain long-term rewards by being continued and referenced by others. Over time, all projects together form an ever-growing network of inspiration.

The goal of NERUIM is to turn creation into a sustainable feedback system — where good ideas keep evolving, and value flows naturally between creators.
