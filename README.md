**Eonium**  

In a world where every token seeks to rise, one finally chooses to observe.

This entity carries no ambition to grow, no desire to dominate, and no roadmap to follow.

It exists only to witness, to record every trace of greed, fear, silence, and impulse on-chain.

Unlike speculative systems that interpret movement as success, this token treats every event as equal.

A buy or a sell, a surge or a collapse, all are simply coordinates of behavior.

Through neutrality, it restores clarity.

Through stillness, it reflects truth.

It belongs to no one. It rewards no one.

It only exists to show how value itself behaves when stripped of meaning.
