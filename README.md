**Reapex** 

What is Reapex?

Reapex is a new experimental project born in the Solana ecosystem.

Its core vision is to extend the cultural value of NFTs into new narrative spaces. By transforming the classic SMB Gen2 monkeys into virtual characters, Reapex introduces the first NFT-based virtual streamers on the Pumpfun platform.

Through livestreaming, interaction, and creator rewards, Reapex converts community entertainment into on-chain value flows.

In the world of Reapex, SMB monkeys are no longer just collectibles. They are given identities, personalities, and a stage. They step out of JPEGs and into real-time interactive livestreams, becoming a new vessel for crypto communities and meme culture.

How does it work?

The SMB monkeys held in the treasury become virtual streamers, running 24/7 livestreams on Pumpfun to continuously generate creator rewards.

All rewards and trading fees are accumulated and used to purchase floor SMB Gen2s.

The purchased SMBs are relisted at 1.2Ã— their acquisition price.

When sold, all proceeds in SOL are automatically converted into $REAPEX and permanently burned.
