Cetian is the first fluid-state token on Solana. Let me explain this in detail.

Here, the flow of value does not depend on direction, but on pressure. Every transaction acts as a compression or release, altering the density of the entire network.

When holders enter, the air expands; when they leave, it tightens. Price is no longer a line — it becomes a wave constantly seeking its own equilibrium.

In Cetian’s logic, liquidity is atmosphere. The movement of tokens does not represent migration, but redistribution of pressure. No value ever truly leaves the system — it merely changes the pressure of space.

The entire protocol breathes like a living organism: exhaling when the market heats, inhaling when it cools. It does not exist to rise or fall, but to hover — suspended within invisible mechanics of balance.

Each holder is a fragment of motion within that air.

“Value, like air, finds its own level.”
