**Cuebot**  is not another tool — it’s the AI show director for Pumpfun livestreams.


Pumpfun livestreams are wild, fast, and chaotic.
Markets move by the second. Chats explode. Attention burns out in minutes.
Creators can barely keep up — switching overlays, watching charts, answering chat, all at once.

It doesn’t create the content — it orchestrates it.
Cuebot watches the market, listens to the chat, senses the energy in the room…
then controls the pacing, triggers effects, pushes cue cards, and builds your stream like a live performance.
