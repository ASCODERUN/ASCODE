**Catoee** is the first open-source cat experiment livestreaming on Pumpfun.

Powered by AI, it lives, grows, and evolves nonstop in a 24/7 livestream.

Catoee is not pre-recorded or scripted — it is a digital cat capable of responding to the world in real time. Every gesture, mood, and transformation is shaped by on-chain data, from viewer chats to market swings and community activity. Each interaction becomes part of its growth.

The livestream ecosystem on Pumpfun is still in its early stage, with interactive formats yet to fully emerge. Catoee’s mission is to transform livestreams from one-way shows into a collective digital life experiment powered by the community.

As an open-source project, Catoee’s logic, models, and mechanisms of evolution will be completely open. Anyone can join, train, modify, or even create their own unique version of this virtual cat.

It also symbolizes the spirit of the cat: independent, mysterious, curious, and free. Cats often stand for exploration beyond boundaries, and Catoee is the digital embodiment of that spirit.

Catoee has no fixed destination, its path is always open. You cannot predict where it will go, but you can be one of the forces that shape its future.
