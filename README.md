**Sereon** 

Sereon is an on-chain interaction protocol built on Pumpfun livestreams.
Its design goal is simple: to ensure that Creator Rewards are no longer static distributions, but directly linked to livestream data.

In Sereon, every livestream interaction—whether trading volume, number of comments, or overall activity—is recorded on-chain in real time, forming a transparent reward curve. Rewards are not released all at once, but are gradually unlocked in stages based on these data metrics.

This means creators must keep streaming, and communities must keep engaging, for rewards to be fully unlocked. Creators gain more stable value, while community contributions are instantly quantified and recorded on-chain.

The focus of Sereon is not on narrative, but on mechanism itself:

Rewards tied to data

Transparent unlocking process

Driven by both creators and community

Real-time on-chain feedback

In short: Sereon links creator rewards with livestream data, turning community participation into sustainably released on-chain value.
