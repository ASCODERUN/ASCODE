**Powkit**  is a next-gen streaming kit built for Pumpfun creators.

It transforms ordinary Pumpfun livestreams into fully interactive trading shows — with real-time market overlays, chat-driven actions, and built-in tools for engagement, rewards, and growth.

With Powkit, every broadcast becomes an arena: viewers trade, chat, and trigger on-screen effects as the market moves — turning your stream into the heartbeat of your token.
