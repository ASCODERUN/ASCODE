Memode is an experimental project on Pumpfun that treats market behavior as a living system.

It transforms trading activity into a form of digital biology — every transaction functions as a piece of DNA that contributes to the organism’s evolution.

Unlike typical tokens that track price, Memode focuses on behavioral memory.

Each buy, sell, and movement on-chain is recorded as a “memory fragment.”

These fragments are continuously recombined based on volatility and activity, forming new behavioral patterns.

As participation increases, the system’s internal structure becomes more complex, creating an adaptive logic layer that evolves over time.

Memode doesn’t just display market data — it grows from it.

Volatility acts as mutation.

Repetition builds memory.

Each participant becomes part of the organism’s genetic structure.

Over time, Memode forms a complete evolutionary record of the market — a transparent, on-chain organism shaped by human actions, emotion, and interaction.
