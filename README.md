Pumpfun live streaming is evolving, but the distribution of Creator Rewards remains too traditional.
We introduce a new vision: the Diamond Forge Protocol.

In Diamond Forge, Creator Rewards are no longer split directly. Instead, they take the form of a raw stone, waiting for the community to forge it into a diamond on-chain.

Every chat message and trade is a cut on the raw stone. The more interaction, the more unique the diamond’s shape, color, and brilliance.

In the end, a one-of-a-kind Diamond NFT is forged by the entire community. It not only carries the rewards but also preserves the memory of the live interaction itself.

Rewards are not released all at once. Some are unlocked instantly, some are locked inside the Diamond NFT, and some remain as fragments to be polished in the next stream.

This ensures creators must keep streaming, and the community must keep engaging, for rewards to be fully unlocked.

Unlike traditional “buyback-and-burn,” Diamond Forge allows fragments to be traded or combined. The reward release process itself becomes a strategic game.

We call this on-chain live experience the Diamond Forging Show — where a raw stone glows, cracks, and transforms into a dazzling diamond NFT.

Diamond Forge is not just a distribution tool; it’s an on-chain ritual.
Every live stream is a collective act of diamond creation.

This is the fusion of finance and narrative — the next evolution of Pumpfun live streaming.
