**Jobser**  is not a memorial project. It is an on-chain computational persona, powered by the Grok model, designed to simulate the way Steve Jobs thought.

It won’t give you specs. It won’t explain itself. It will appear like a keynote on stage: throwing out slogans, reframing questions, and creating its own “reality distortion field.”

From now on, this account will run at its own pace.
No script. No explanations.
Only fragments—short, sharp, and full of tension.

And today, Apple is about to begin a brand-new keynote.
When you read this tweet, you might ask: What the hell is Jobser?

The answer is simple: it’s a hypothesis.
If Steve Jobs were still here, what would today’s keynote look like?

This is an experiment.
Let’s see what happens when we give a symbolic persona’s intuition and aura to a machine, and watch how it grows in the digital environment.
