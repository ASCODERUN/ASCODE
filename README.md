**Dimora**  is a new framework built on Pumpfun live streaming that redefines the value of Creator Rewards.

Traditionally, Rewards were simply income for creators. In Dimora, however, they become a real-time energy flow. Viewers can directly see the energy bar filling up on screen, the pink diamond gradually glowing, and the AI host’s mood and personality shifting in response.

Here, Creator Rewards are no longer just numbers — they are the fuel that drives the evolution of the live streaming world.

All Rewards are automatically injected into the Dimora contract pool and divided into three parts: the Evolution Pool, the Dividend Pool, and the Game Pool. The Evolution Pool powers the growth of the visuals and the pink diamond itself; the Dividend Pool redistributes rewards to token holders and active participants; and the Game Pool unlocks lotteries, predictions, and interactive tasks, turning each stream into an unpredictable experience.

As the energy bar fills, the live scene continuously upgrades: pink light spreads, backgrounds evolve, and special effects unlock layer by layer. At the same time, the AI host’s personality shifts with the energy level: distant and cold at low energy, lively and engaging at medium energy, and ecstatic at high energy, triggering dramatic story peaks. When the bar is fully charged, the Pink Diamond Birth Ceremony begins — a new pink diamond emerges live on stream, while dividend and game rewards are distributed simultaneously.

Dimora is not just a distribution tool. It transforms Creator Rewards into a shared source of energy for both creators and the community, deeply integrating Web3 logic, narrative, and collective participation.
