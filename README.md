**Commir**  is the first mirror protocol on Solana that structures community behavior data into framework logic.
It records, reflects, and synchronizes every on-chain interaction, turning community behavior into systemic form.
Within Commir, a community is no longer a loose group — it becomes a self-evolving structure.
Each member’s action is captured, reorganized, and projected back into the whole, forming an ever-updating mirror.
It represents a new mode of organization — where the community no longer depends on platforms, but exists as a protocol reflecting and running itself.
