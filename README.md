**STEP01**  is an open probabilistic protocol that connects Polymarket’s prediction layer with on-chain execution.
It transforms market belief into programmable behavior, allowing decentralized systems to act not by fixed rules, but by the collective intelligence of participants.

In traditional blockchains, every transaction and contract call is deterministic — the same input always leads to the same output. STEP01 challenges this foundation by introducing programmable uncertainty, enabling a new class of contracts that respond to probability, sentiment, and real-time prediction signals.

By integrating Polymarket’s live odds into its STEP Engine, STEP01 allows developers to bias randomness, weight outcomes, and route different execution paths based on belief data. The result is a blockchain that breathes: adaptive, unpredictable, and aligned with real-world probabilities.

Whether it’s DeFi protocols that adjust yield according to market expectations, governance systems that execute based on prediction consensus, or game mechanics powered by belief-weighted randomness — STEP01 provides the framework for a new probabilistic economy where markets don’t just forecast the future; they define it.
