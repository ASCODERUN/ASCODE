**Genvum** 

Genvum is the first Gene Incubation Protocol, a blockchain-native system designed to incubate unknown life through livestreaming.

On Pumpfun, every action from the community is no longer just data, but transformed into the primal genes of life, driving its division, growth, and evolution. You are not a viewer, you are the gene.

Buying, selling, holding, and interacting all inscribe the lifeform’s “genetic blueprint”; market fluctuations and community heat become its growth nutrients; sudden bursts of activity may trigger unpredictable evolution events.

This mechanism ensures the lifeform does not grow according to a preset script, but instead divides, mutates, and evolves in real time based on community behavior. At the same time, Creator Rewards are no longer mere revenue sharing—they are injected directly as nutrients into the incubation process, allowing value flows to feed the lifeform’s growth and making every participant not only a gene, but also a driver.

When the incubation cycle reaches its end, the lifeform will be born in a new form, carrying the genetic imprints and value contributions of all participants, becoming a true on-chain creation of the community.

At its core, Genvum is not about watching, but about shaping together.

This is an experiment of origin, evolution, and the unknown.
