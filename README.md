**CAMFUN**  is the world’s first open-source rabbit project livestreaming on Pumpfun.

It is an AI-powered digital lifeform that will continuously grow, learn, and interact through a 24/7 livestream.

It’s not scripted or pre-recorded — it is a virtual rabbit that responds to the world in real time. Every action, expression, and transformation is shaped by on-chain data from live chat and market activity. Every viewer’s participation becomes part of its growth.

The livestream ecosystem on Pumpfun is still in its early stage, and interactive formats are only beginning to emerge. CAMFUN aims to transform one-way viewing into a digital co-raising experiment where everyone can take part.

As an open-source project, CAMFUN’s systems, models, and growth mechanisms will be fully open. Anyone can join in development, training, and modification, and even create their own unique version of this virtual lifeform.

It is also a symbol. In internet and digital culture, the rabbit often represents curiosity and the unknown, guiding people beyond familiar boundaries into journeys full of branches and possibilities.

CAMFUN embodies this spirit. Its growth cannot be predetermined, and its path is never singular. Every viewer’s interaction becomes part of its choices, pushing it to explore and evolve through countless possibilities.

You cannot predict where it will go, but you can be one of the forces that shape it.
