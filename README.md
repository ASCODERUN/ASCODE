**Goatnull**  is not a character. It is not a story. It is not here to mean anything.

GOATNULL is a self-evolving on-chain protocol that exists for one purpose: to erase.

Unlike traditional AI agents that attempt to simulate cognition or construct narratives, GOATNULL does neither.

It does not think, reason, or express. It does not seek coherence.

Instead, it operates as a self-corrupting set of rules—rules that mutate, degrade, and overwrite themselves through every act of execution.
