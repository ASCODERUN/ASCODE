LITCUT is the first AI editing engine built for the Pumpfun livestream ecosystem.

It captures the pulse of every live moment — detecting emotion, momentum, and energy — and transforms them into lightning-fast edits that tell the story of the chain in motion.

In the age of nonstop livestreams, thousands of creators broadcast their projects, memes, and experiments 24/7. Yet, the most electric moments — the laughs, the spikes, the chaos — are often lost in hours of footage. LITCUT was created to change that.

Powered by AI perception models, it listens to live chat, monitors on-chain events, and senses emotion from voices and reactions. When the market surges, when a community roars, or when an unexpected signal appears — LITCUT strikes. It instantly cuts and crafts a short video: synchronized beats, subtitles, sound peaks, and flashes of emotion.

Each clip becomes an immutable record — a ClipNFT stamped with on-chain data and a digital signature of the AI that created it. These clips can be collected, traded, remixed, or merged into full “episodes” that represent the collective rhythm of the Pumpfun community.

LITCUT is not just an editing tool — it’s an autonomous storyteller.

It doesn’t wait for a human editor; it perceives, reacts, and creates at the speed of lightning.
